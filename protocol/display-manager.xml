      The display manager can use this interface to manage the system
      compositor. It has requests to add new clients, to transition between
      clients.
      
      All clients of the system compositor are assumed to be fullscreen.
      With the exception of transitions, the compositor will generally
      display only a single client at once.

        The compositor may perform some transition animation between the two
        clients, such as a crossfade or cube animation. During the transition
        no client will have input focus.
